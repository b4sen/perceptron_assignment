# Rosenblatt perceptron and LMS training algorithms for a Vienna UT assignment

## Task 1.1.1

### Select two numbers from the MNIST dataset and extract two arbitrary features

We selected the numbers 0 and 1 and our features are the area of the smallest enclosing rectangle and edge count using Canny edge detection.
A bit of preprocessing had to be done to remove noise -> blur


## Task 1.1.2

### Implement the online and batch training algorithm

## Task 1.2

### LMS training algorithm
